# 06 Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

Using the Third-Party API, OpenWeather Map, an application was created to allow the user to 
input a city name and have the current weather displayed along with a 5 day forecast in metric values. 

 The current weather displays the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature in celsius, the humidity & windspeed in kilometers per hour.    

 The 5 day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the wind speed & humidity.  

The city searched for is saved in the search history, and a button is created for the user to be able to click on again to view the current weather & future conditions.  


 Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Installation 

Access the application via https://rkml14.github.io/06-weather-dashboard/ 


The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
