# 06 Weather Dashboard

## Description

Using the Third-Party API, OpenWeather Map, an application was created to allow the user to 
input a city name and have the current weather displayed along with a 5 day forecast in metric values. 

 The current weather displays the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature in celsius, the humidity & windspeed in kilometers per hour.    

 The 5 day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the wind speed & humidity.  

The city searched for is saved in the search history, and a button is created for the user to be able to click on again to view the current weather & future conditions.  The User is prompted for an actual city name if they input a null value.  Neither null values or duplicate city names are saved to the search button history.  When a previously searched city button is clicked, the applicaiton repopulates the current weather & five day forecast for that city.
