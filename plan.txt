i need a function for city


Input field for user to enter city & submit button

take that city and convert to lon & lan  for both the 5 day & current weather

need to output the current weather with the following  
    -ciy name
    -date
    -icon representation of weather conditions
    -the temperature
    -the humidity
    -the wind speed

Make a loop?  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) ?  

need to save the above to local storage as a button for user to reference again if required
    need to append the button to the page under the search field.
