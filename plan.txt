i need a function for city - i have this, it puts the information into lat-lon function
i need a function for lon and lang  - HAVE THIS.  Also contains current weather that I need to display

I need a function for 5 day forecast 


Input field for user to enter city & submit button  - this works
    need to use to find current weather conditions   - need to output this information

take that city and convert to lon & lan  for both the 5 day & current weather

need to output the current weather with the following  - STILL NEED TO DO
    -ciy name
    -date
    -icon representation of weather conditions
    -the temperature
    -the humidity
    -the wind speed

I've pulled out the values so now I can put them out to the page 



need to output the 5 day forecast with the following     - 5 days 5 cards?
    -the date    
    -icon of weather conditions
    -the temp
    -the wind speed
    -the humidity
Make a loop?  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) ?  

need to save the above to local storage as a button for user to reference again if required
    need to append the button to the page under the search field.  



things to do: figure out the fetch functions.  I don't understand how to do the geo locate openweathermap
